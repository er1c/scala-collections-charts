Scala 2.8 Collection API Charts
-------------------------------

This is a small collection of [Graphviz][] `.dot` files containing the chart description for the most relevant types of the **Scala 2.8 Collection API**.  
You can see the end result on [this page](http://www.decodified.com/scala/collections-api.xml).

Feel free to use them to your liking, of course I am also open to any improvement ideas you might have.

### How to build ###

1. Install graphviz on your machine. On OS/X this is easily done via [Homebrew][] or [MacPorts][].
2. Clone this git repository to any directory
3. Run `chmod +x build.sh`
4. Run `./build.sh`
5. Retrieve the generated SVG files from the /target directory

Cheers,
